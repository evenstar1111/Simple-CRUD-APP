## Simple-CRUD-APP

#### A Simple app created based on CRUD operations with Node js, Express and MongoDb


Frameworks and libraries used -
- express
- mongodb
- body-parser
- ejs (Embedded Javascript)

<br />

Here you can **INSERT**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE** data from a mongodb database by sending **POST**, **PUT** & **DELETE** requests to the server.
<br />
<br />

To see the updated data from database click on **`refresh`** button at the top left corner of table section. It makes a **GET** request to the server and collects all the data and updates the DOM.
<br />
<br />

Used javascript to send the requests with ***fetch*** api.
<br />
<br />

The app is deployed to ***Heroku***.

To understand how **REST API** works and to build a simple CRUD app [`this article`](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/) by ***zellwk*** helped me a lot.
